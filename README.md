### CODE 1) :

Write a python function, nearest_palindrome() which accepts a number and returns the nearest palindrome greater than the given number

Input 12300 
OUTPUT: 12321

### CODE 2) :

DO SMS encoding



### CODE 3) :

Write a python function, check_anagram() which accepts two strings and returns True, if one string is an anagram of another string. Otherwise returns False.

INPUT : eat, tea
OUTPUT: True

INPUT : backward,drawback
OUTPUT:  False (Reason: character 'a' repeats at position 6, not an anagram)



### CODE 4) :

Write a python program that accepts a text and displays a string which contains the word with the largest frequency in the text and the frequency itself separated by a space.

Rules:
The word should have the largest frequency.
In case multiple words have the same frequency, then choose the word that has the maximum length.
Assumptions:
The text has no special characters other than space.
The text would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.

INPUT = "Work like you do not need money love like you have never been hurt and dance like no one is watching"	OUTPUT = like 3


### C0DE 5):

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

Write a python program to find and display the number of circular primes less than the given limit.
